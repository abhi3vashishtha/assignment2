1. MOST IMPORTANT -->>>Please install flatbuffers for python and C++ before running the code (I couldn't follow the git submodule instructions due to lack of time)

2. Compile the c++ file Encoder.cpp
Run it. It will create ClientData.bin file in decoder/data folder

3. Now run decoder/decoder.py file to read the data.

4. I've included the client.fbs file for reference
